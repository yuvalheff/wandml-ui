# Exploration Experiments Summary

This document summarizes the exploration experiments conducted to inform the experiment plan for Iris species classification.

## Experiment Overview
I conducted systematic experiments to evaluate different approaches for preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation strategies for the Iris classification task.

## Dataset Analysis
- **Training Set**: 120 samples (40 per species)
- **Test Set**: 30 samples (10 per species)  
- **Features**: 4 numerical botanical measurements
- **Target**: 3 balanced classes (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
- **Data Quality**: No missing values, clean measurements

## Experiment 1: Preprocessing Comparison

### Methodology
Tested different scaling approaches using LogisticRegression as baseline with 5-fold cross-validation.
