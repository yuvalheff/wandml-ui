Petal measurements provide strong discriminative power, especially for separating Iris-setosa from other species. The data shows no missing values and follows normal distributions within each class. Feature scaling may be beneficial given different measurement ranges (sepal width: 2.0-4.4 vs petal length: 1.1-6.9). The linear separability mentioned in the problem description is evident in petal measurements.",
